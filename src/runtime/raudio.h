// The audio half of raylib.h, for raudio.c built standalone (RAUDIO_STANDALONE):
// the types and the functions of raylib's audio module, and the allocator
// macros that module expects its header to define. Taken from
// vendor/raylib/src/raylib.h (raylib, zlib/libpng license, Copyright (c)
// 2013-2026 Ramon Santamaria); keep it in step with that file when raylib moves.
//
// Only src/runtime/culebra_raudio.c and culebra_rt_audio.cc include this. A
// translation unit that includes raylib.h (the Canvas window, Scene) must not
// include it too: the two declare the same types.
